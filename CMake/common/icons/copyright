Copyright:

  In the preparation of the 0.8.90 release Novell took care of tracking
  down all the contributors to get them to relicense their artwork
  into Public Domain.

  The COPYING file of the tarball states the following:
  | The icons in this repository are herefore released into the Public Domain.

  Additionally the copyright status of the files was tracked in the CVS and the
  rdf properties of the SVGs adjusted for all files that were put into Public
  Domain (see rdf:about and rdf:resource).  Both fields contain a link to the
  Creative Commons Public Domain Dediciation[0] as reproduced below:
