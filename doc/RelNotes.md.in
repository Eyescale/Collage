# Introduction {#Introduction}

Welcome to Collage, a high-performance C++ library for developing
object-oriented distributed applications.

Collage @VERSION_MAJOR@.@VERSION_MINOR@ is a preview release for an upcoming
stable 1.2 release which has over eight years of development and decades of
experience into a high-performance and mature C++ library. It is intended for
all C++ developers creating distributed applications with high-level
abstractions. Collage @VERSION_MAJOR@.@VERSION_MINOR@ can be retrieved by
downloading the source code or one of the precompiled packages.

## Features {#Features}

Collage provides different levels of abstraction to facilitate the
development distributed applications:

* Network Connections: stream-oriented point-to-point and reliable multicast
  connections for TCP/IP, SDP, InfiniBand RDMA, UDT, events, named and anonymous
  pipes, memory buffers and reliable multicast over UDP.
* Peer-to-Peer Messaging: Endian-safe node-to-node message communication with
  thread-aware message dispatch.
* Synchronization: Distributed barriers and synchronous messaging.
* Object data distribution: high-performance, object-oriented, versioned data
  distribution for C++ objects based on delta serialization.

# About {#About}

Collage is a cross-platform library, designed to run on any modern operating
system, including all Unix variants and the Windows operating system. Collage
uses CMake and [Buildyard](https://github.com/Eyescale/Buildyard) to create a
platform-specific build environment. The following platforms and build
environments are tested for version @VERSION_MAJOR@.@VERSION_MINOR@:

* Linux: Ubuntu 14.04, RHEL 6.5 (Makefile, i386, x64)
* Windows: 7 (Visual Studio 2008, i386, x64)
* Mac OS X: 10.8 (Makefile, XCode, i386, x64)

The Equalizer Programming and User Guide covers the basics of Collage
programming. The API documentation can be found on
[github](http://eyescale.github.io/).

As with any open source project, the available source code, in particular the
shipped tools provide a reference for developing or porting applications.

Technical questions can be posted to the eq-dev Mailing List, or
directly to info@equalizergraphics.com.

Commercial support, custom software development and porting services are
available from [Eyescale](http://www.eyescale.ch). Please contact
[info@eyescale.ch](mailto:info@eyescale.ch?subject=Collage%20support) for
further information.
